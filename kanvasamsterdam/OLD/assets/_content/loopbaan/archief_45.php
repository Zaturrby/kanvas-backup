	<h2>An internship at Wilfried Lentz Gallery Rotterdam</a></h2>
	<h5>Wilfried Lentz Gallery</h5>	
	<p>
	Wilfried Lentz Gallery offers an international program of contemporary art. It represents artists whose individual works share an interest in the cultural and social conditions of our environment, how it is formed and perceived, as well as its stories and myths.  Most of the artists represented by the gallery express their ideas through innovative use of the mediums of ?lm and photography, as well as through performances and installations.<br><br>
 	The gallery started in the beginning of 2008 and is housed in the middle of Rotterdams magni?cent Groot Handelsgebouw (formerly a wholesale trade building). We participate in international fairs like Liste Basel, Independent New York and Frieze London.<br><br>
 	For our small and dedicated team we are regularly looking for enthusiastic interns. Through our coaching you will get acquainted with all aspects of the international gallery business.<br><br>
